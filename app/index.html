                  The rise of the knowledge worker – and how to manage them

                  Corporates that carry on working the same way they have for the last ten years 
                  are going to be superceded. Even those who are making a good fist of doing things 
                  differently. The market will be cannibalised by start ups. The cost 
                  of building a global company has suddenly diminished. 
                  A global advertising campaign that previously only a corporate could afford to do 
                  is now available to anyone with a clever viral idea. The corporates who rely on a 
                  steady product and customer base will find their lunch eaten by fast growth competitors.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We have moved from the era of manufacturing to era of information..
                  and now to the era of innovation. The old way of creating a new product - get a big
                  investment, build a product, big bang launch – will disappear. 
                  Everyone will understand how to manage their biggest risk:
                  that people won’t buy their product. Failure is now good.

            <h2>OUTSOURCED MICRO-MANUFACTURE CREATES AN UNRECOGNISABLE PRODUCT MARKET-PLACE</h2>
              <p>Already, you can design a circuit-board in your browser, place
              an order and have it shipped to you. You can do this online, in
              your spare time. In the past we relied on large volumes to offset
              high cost – and therefore created high barriers to entry for new
              competitors. Launching a physical product has traditionally taken
              a long time. No longer.</p>
              <p>Indigogo is a great example -  it's funded by interested parties
              and products are crowdsourced. Batches are now smaller. Niche products
              are suddenly viable. The cost of a prototype is almost nothing.
              Ten years ago, you would remortgage your house to pioneer your
              invention. In 10 years time, the product development process will
              have matured and cheap prototyping will be the normal way of
              doing things.</p>
              <p>Companies that rely on scale and 'being the big guys' will be
              cannibalised. Craft cars are already being built. Sous-vide
              machines used to be only affordable by huge restaurants. Now you
              can pay $200 for an Indigogo sous-vide machine. All the tools
              that were only available to corporates are now democratised. 3d
              printing chemicals radically change the way drugs are
              distributed and as a result disrupts our current methods of
              research and legislation.</p>

                “Free market zealot and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has proven he has no real loyalty to drivers. He
                has long defended surge pricing by saying it was getting more
                cars on the road and more drivers on the platform, and that
                eventually, he hoped all that supply would then force prices
                down across the platform. And at this past year’s Code
                Conference he practically salivated at the notion of a network
                of self-driving cars that could take out the “cost” of human
                drivers. You know the old adage about transporting the scorpion
                across the river... Kalanick has made his loyalties clear and
                they aren’t to drivers or riders, but the free
                market.”</p>

                  The focus will shift from bureaucracy and ‘how we work’ to the citizen and ‘what they need’.
                  This means a big push to enabling participation. Citizenship will take on a new meaning.</p>

                  Social networks have already increased the demand for transparency in global governance - the Arab Spring being the most explosive example. 
                  This type of ‘small power’ will increase in influence. The USA will be the dinosaur.

               <p>
                   They are pioneering transparency, getting rid of dinosaurs, opening up the market,

                   There will soon be a generation of civil servants who go

              time, we will see major disruption to the way logistics companies
              work, from driverless trucks to crowd sourced delivery of goods –
              all powered by digital. Logistics companies will likely still own
              the distance from manufacture to retailer, but the last mile
              problem of retailer to customer is ripe for innovation and
              disruption. Trucks driving round from FedEx, UPS etc will be replaced with
              drones or Uber for delivery.</p>

                  <p>The future is arriving fast. Nature magazine tells us:
                  “Advocates of ‘quantum computers’ say that these machines
                  will be able to perform tasks too big for classical computers
                  to tackle, such as cracking the codes that protect bank
                  transactions. Now several teams have solid evidence that
                  quantum physics does indeed embody a level of complexity that
                  classical computers could never match.”</p>

                  <p>In practical terms, this means that we may be able to
                  solve complex probability puzzles that are currently too
                  intensive for current computer capability. For example
                  understanding the origins of our solar system or exploring
                  the future of our planet require complex calculations run on
                  high-power computers.</p>

                      Energy efficiency is the other big news. Researchers at
                      HP have been working on an alternative computational
                      design that promises significant energy efficiency. They
                      are close to completing key edge cases before they target
                      major organisations with huge IT architecture.

                    It gets interesting at a consumer level around increasing battery
                    life of hand held devices where there has been little
                    innovation. Instead companies like Apple and Intel have tried to
                    reduce size to create space for bigger batteries. But
                    there’s little more they can do. The battery of an iPhone’s
                    takes up to 70% (or even more) of the device’s whole size.

                    So the arrival of optical (photonic) computing transforms
                    uptime.Imagine a phone that you don’t need to charge every day,
                    but it could work up to 3 days in a row. It’s still not
                    going to be a Nokia 3210 that used to work for a week but
                    it’s already a HUGE improvement over our current
                    standards.</p>
