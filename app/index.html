                  Corporates that carry on working the same way they have for the last ten years 
                  are going to be superceded. Even those who are making a good fist of doing things 
                  differently. The market will be completely cannibalised by start ups. The cost 
                  of building a global company has suddenly diminished. 
                  A global advertising campaign that previously only a corporate could afford to do 
                  is now available to anyone with a clever viral idea. The corporates who rely on a 
                  steady product and product base will find their lunch eaten by fast growth competitors.

                  We moved from the era of manufacturing to era of information..
                  and now to the era of innovation. The old way of creating a new product - get a big
                  investment, build a product, big bang launch – will disappear. 
                  Everyone will understand how to manage their biggest risk –
                  that people won’t buy their product. Failure is now good.

            <h2>OUTSOURCED MICRO-MANUFACTURE CREATES AN UNRECOGNISABLE PRODUCT MARKET-PLACE</h2>
              <p>Already, you can design a circuit-board in your browser, place
              an order and have it shipped to you. You can do this online, in
              your spare time. It has relied on large volumes to offset high
              cost – and therefore created high barriers to entry for new
              competitors. Launching a physical product has traditionally taken
              a long time. No longer.</p>
              <p>Indigogo is a great example - funded by interested parties and
              products crowdsourced. Batches are now smaller. Niche products
              are suddenly viable. The cost of a prototype is almost nothing.
              Ten years ago, you would remortgage your house to pioneer your
              invention. In 10 years time, the product development process will
              have matured and this will be the normal way of doing things.</p>
              <p>Companies that rely on scale and being the big guys will be
              cannibalised. Craft cars are already being built. Sous-vis
              machines, used to be only affordable by huge restaurants. Now you
              can pay $300 for an Indigogo sous-vis machine. All the tools that
              were only available to corporates are now democratised. 3d
              printing chemicals – radically change the way drugs are
              distributed.</p>

                “Free market zealot and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has proven he has no real loyalty to drivers. He
                has long defended surge pricing by saying it was getting more
                cars on the road and more drivers on the platform, and that
                eventually, he hoped all that supply would then force prices
                down across the platform. And at this past year’s Code
                Conference he practically salivated at the notion of a network
                of self-driving cars that could take out the “cost” of human
                drivers. You know the old adage about transporting the scorpion
                across the river... Kalanick has made his loyalties clear and
                they aren’t to drivers or riders, but the free

              problem of retailer to customer is ripe for innovation and
              disruption. FedEx, UPS etc trucks driving around will be replaced

                  <p>From Nature magazine: “Advocates of ‘quantum computers’ say
                  that these machines will be able to perform tasks too big for
                  classical computers to tackle, such as cracking the codes that
                  protect bank transactions. Now several teams have solid evidence
                  that quantum physics does indeed embody a level of complexity
                  that classical computers could never match.”</p>

                  <p>In practical terms, this means that we may be able to solve
                  complex probability puzzles that are currently too intensive for
                  current computer capability. For example understanding the
                  origins of our solar system or exploring the future of our planet
                  and humanity require complex calculations run on high-power
                  computers.</p>

                    The other big feature of optical computing - of even more
                    interesting to digital product creators - is energy efficiency.
                    Researchers at HP have been working on an alternative
                    computational design that promises significant energy efficiency.
                    They are really close to working out some of the edge cases
                    before they enter the</p>
                    <p>market, targeting big IT companies and major organisations
                    that operate with huge IT architectures. It gets interesting when
                    they can apply the technology on a consumer level and increase
                    battery life of hand held devices. There has not been a lot of
                    innovation in the area of battery capacities. Instead companies

                    <p>Apple and Intel are trying to reduce the size of electronics
                    so that there will be more space for bigger batteries in their
                    electronics. But there’s not a lot they can do any more.
                    Effectively the battery of an iPhone’s takes up to 70% (or even
                    more) of the device’s whole size. So with the arrival of
                    optical (photonic) computing we</p>
                    <p>could get more uptime with the same existing batteries. Imagine a phone that you don’t need to charge every day, but it could work up to 3 days in
                    a row. It’s still not going to be a Nokia 3210 that used to work for a week but it’s already a HUGE improvement over our current standards.</p>
